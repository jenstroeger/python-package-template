# This is a trusted builder implemented as a reusable workflow that can be called by other
# Actions workflows. It checks, tests, and builds the artifacts including SBOM and documentations,
# and computes hash digests as output to be used by a SLSA provenance generator. The artifacts are always uploaded
# for every job to be used for debugging purposes, but they will be removed within the specified retention days.
# Even though we run the build in a matrix to check against different platforms, due to a known limitation of
# reusable workflows that do not support setting strategy property from the caller workflow, we
# only generate artifacts for ubuntu-latest and Python 3.10, which can be used to create a release.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#limitations.

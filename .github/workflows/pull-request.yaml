# package (https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen) and its `cz`
# tool to check the title of the PR and all commit messages of the branch
# which triggers this Action.

    # Install Commitizen without using the package's Makefile: that's much faster than
    # creating a venv and installing heaps of dependencies that aren't required for
    # this job. Then run Commitizen to check the title of the PR which triggered this
    # workflow, and check all commit messages of the PR's branch. If any of the checks
    # fails then this job fails.
